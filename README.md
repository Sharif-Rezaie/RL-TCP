# RL-TCP
For years, TCP has been explored and discussed for end-to-end congestioncontrolmechanisms.Although,variouseffortsandoptimizationtechniqueshavetakenplacetofindanoptimalapproach indealingwithallkindsofnetworkarchitectureandscenarios.But theTCPversiononlyfollowstheruleswhichtheyaredefinedby.

This project discusses the implementation of Reinforcement Learning(RL)basedTCPcongestioncontrolpythonAgentwhich uses RL based techniques to somehow overcome the rule-based shortcomings of TCP.
